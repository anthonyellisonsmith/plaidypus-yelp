Given more time I would have added some front-end features and worked on the look
Basic functionality is working though
Solution is split into two: ReactJS front-end and a small NodeJS server

To start server:
	cd api
	npm start
	
To start front-end:
	cd app
	npm start
	
With both running the page will be accessible on localhost:3000
